A little description of my first react projects:
A Kanban board created using React and the react-beautiful-dnd library, which is an elegant drag-and-drop library specifically designed for React, it simplifies the implementation of complex drag-and-drop features, providing a smooth and visually pleasing user experience.

Also a few comments in each file describing the functionality of the code.
