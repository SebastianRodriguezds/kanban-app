Kanban Board is a lightweight drag-and-drop interface inspired by modern task management tools like Trello. Built entirely with React and `react-beautiful-dnd`, this project gave me hands-on experience with structuring dynamic UIs and managing component state during user interactions.

It allows users to drag tasks between columns or reorder them within the same section, with real-time visual feedback and smooth transitions. Though it currently uses mocked data, it's architected in a way that makes it easy to connect with an API or persistent storage later on.

Some of the features:
* Responsive layout styled with plain CSS
* Built with React functional components and hooks
* Intuitive drag-and-drop interactions using `react-beautiful-dnd`
* Dynamic rendering of task columns and cards
* Easy to extend with features like backend integration or local storage
* Clean, modular codebase (`Kanban`, `Card`, `mockData`)

What's next:
* Add functionality to create, edit, and delete tasks or columns
* Implement persistent storage with backend or localStorage
* Add user authentication and personalized boards

This project helped reinforce my knowledge of React hooks, state management, and how to create smooth drag-and-drop experiences with clear UX.
